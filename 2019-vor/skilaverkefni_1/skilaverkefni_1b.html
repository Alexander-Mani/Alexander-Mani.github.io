                                                distracted by the readable content of a page when 
                                                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum 
                                                is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
                                                letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content 
                                                here', making it look like readable English. Many 
                                                desktop publishing packages and web page editors 
                                                now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and 
                                                a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
                                                sites still in their infancy. Various versions have 
                                                evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
                                                sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
